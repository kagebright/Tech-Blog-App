# 14 Model-View- Controller (MVC): Tech Blog Application

## Description

This week's task is to build a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts as well as comment on other developer's posts. This site is completely built from scatch and will be deployed to Heroku. The app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Technologies used :

- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Handlebars.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, npm, MySQL2, Sequelize, and MVC architecture

## Running the Application:
1. Run `npm start` in the project directory to start the development server.
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.
