# 14 Model-View- Controller (MVC): Bright's Tech Blog

## Description

This week's task is to build a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts as well as comment on other developer's posts. This site is completely built from scatch and will be deployed to Heroku. The app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Technologies used :

- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Handlebars.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MySQL2, Sequelize, and MVC architecture

## Getting Started

- Install the dependencies `npm install`
- Create the `.env` file and configure the database connection details:
- Start the application with `npm start`.
